## My process

I started this project by checking the design on the Figma file, then I created the website's structure with HTML and then used CSS to implement the style. To create the layout I used Flexbox and Grid. The logic part of the application was built with JavaScript where I had to change the images path and create an event for the navigation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the process of building the webpage I learned to combine Flexbox and CSS Grid to create the layout.
